DScript
=======

DScript is a simple scripting language, made to be embedded within games and
other applications. It is written in C#.

Originally, DScript was meant to be a simple console command language with a few extra features, deriving from
the [Dive game engine](https://github.com/redxdev/dive/)'s console command language. It ended up becoming
a bigger and bigger project until it turned into a full-on scripting language.
